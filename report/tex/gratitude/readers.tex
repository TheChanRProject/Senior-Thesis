I would like to exhibit words of gratitude to Dr. Yan Li for teaching me about data mining, machine learning, and database technologies to develop a thorough understanding required to do a thesis of this magnitude. I would also like to give special thanks to Dr. David Bachman for teaching me about object-oriented Python programming in his Math and 3D printing course and for taking the time to be my second thesis reader. I would also like to thank Dr. Michael Spezio at Scripps College for deepening my understanding of machine learning through its application with neural signals and sharing his wisdom about audio signal processing and words of advice about conducting end-to-end machine learning for any project. Also, I give many thanks to my advisor, Dr. Linus Yamane at Pitzer College for believing in my academic efforts through his constant support and communication with me. Finally, I want to thank my father, Dr. Samir Chatterjee at Claremont Graduate University for supporting me through every trial and tribulation during my undergraduate career.
